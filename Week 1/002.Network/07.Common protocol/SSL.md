The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the privacy and security of data transferred between a client and a server. This protocol facilitates the authentication of the server by the client and enables the establishment of a secure connection.

When a server possesses a digital certificate, SSL-enabled browsers can engage in secure communication with the server using SSL. SSL provides the means to create a security-enabled website on the Internet or within a private intranet. Browsers that lack support for HTTP over SSL cannot request URLs using HTTPS. Additionally, non-SSL browsers do not permit the submission of forms that require secure communications.

The SSL protocol initiates a security handshake to establish a secure connection between the client and the server. This handshake involves the mutual agreement on security keys and encryption algorithms to be employed during the session. The client authenticates the server, and optionally, the server can request the client's certificate. Following the handshake, SSL encrypts and decrypts all information exchanged between the client and the server, including the URL requested by the client, the contents of any submitted forms, access authorization information (e.g., usernames and passwords), and all data transmitted between the client and the server.

HTTPS, which stands for HTTP Secure, is a distinctive protocol that combines SSL and HTTP. HTML documents linking to SSL-protected content should specify "https://" as an anchor. Clients can also open SSL-protected documents by specifying "https://" in the URL, indicating a request for an SSL-protected document.

Due to the distinct protocols and their use of different ports (443 for HTTPS and 80 for HTTP), it is possible to run both SSL and non-SSL requests simultaneously. This capability allows information to be provided to users without security when needed, while specific information is exclusively accessible to browsers making secure requests. For instance, an online retail company can support users browsing through merchandise without security, but when it comes to submitting order forms and providing credit card numbers, security is enforced.

Certificates are fundamental components of SSL. They serve as digital affirmations that verify the identities of entities involved in SSL communication. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a broader system that encompasses digital certificates, certificate authorities, registration authorities, certificate management services, and X.500 directories. PKI is integral to the robust functioning of SSL and is employed to establish a secure framework for digital communication.

SSL session IDs are cached by the IBM HTTP Server when secure connections are established between web clients and the server. This caching mechanism facilitates subsequent SSL session requests, enabling a shortened SSL handshake during session establishment. The Session ID cache is enabled by default on all supported platforms, contributing to the efficiency and optimization of SSL sessions.

In summary, SSL is a crucial protocol for securing data transmission over the Internet. By combining SSL and HTTP in the HTTPS protocol, websites can provide a secure environment for sensitive interactions, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of information exchanged between clients and servers. The use of digital certificates, PKI, and session ID caching further enhances the security infrastructure, making SSL a cornerstone in the realm of secure web communication.
