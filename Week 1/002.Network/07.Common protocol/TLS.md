Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely adopted security protocol designed to ensure privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. Primarily used for encrypting communication between web applications and servers, TLS also finds applications in encrypting email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed TLS, and the first version was published in 1999, with TLS 1.3 being the most recent version as of 2018.

TLS evolved from the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), developed by Netscape, and sometimes the terms TLS and SSL are used interchangeably. TLS is employed in conjunction with the HTTP protocol to create HTTPS, a standard practice for securing websites. Browsers like Google Chrome actively flag non-HTTPS sites, and users are increasingly cautious of websites lacking the HTTPS padlock icon.

The three main components of the TLS protocol are Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity. Encryption conceals transferred data from third parties, Authentication ensures parties' claimed identities, and Integrity verifies data authenticity.

For a website or application to use TLS, it requires a TLS certificate installed on its origin server. This certificate, also known as an SSL certificate, is issued by a certificate authority to validate the server's identity. The TLS certificate contains information about the domain owner and the server's public key.

The TLS connection initiation involves a TLS handshake, a sequence between the client device and the web server. During the handshake, they specify the TLS version, decide on cipher suites, authenticate the server's identity using its TLS certificate, and generate session keys for encrypting messages after the handshake.

TLS affects web application performance, but the impact is minimal. The complex setup process involves some load time and computational power expenditure. Technologies like TLS False Start and TLS Session Resumption help mitigate potential latency by allowing data transmission before the handshake is complete and enabling an abbreviated handshake for previously communicated clients and servers.

TLS 1.3, released in 2018, has further improved speed by reducing the handshake to one round trip. Implementing TLS on a website is facilitated by services like Cloudflare, which offers free TLS/SSL certificates. For those not using Cloudflare, acquiring an SSL certificate from a certificate authority is necessary, often incurring a fee, and installing the certificate on origin servers completes the process.
