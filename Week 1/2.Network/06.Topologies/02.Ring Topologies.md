Your description provides a clear overview of ring topology in networking. Here are some additional points and clarifications:

1. **Data Transmission:** In a ring topology, data travels in a circular fashion from one device to the next until it reaches its destination. Each device in the network receives the data packet and checks whether it is the intended recipient. If it is, the device processes the data; otherwise, it simply passes the packet along to the next device in the ring.

2. **Token Passing:** The concept of a "token" is commonly associated with ring topologies. A token is a special data packet that circulates the network. Only the device that holds the token is allowed to transmit data. This method of token passing helps in avoiding data collisions and ensures orderly data transmission in the network.

3. **Unidirectional vs. Bidirectional Ring Networks:**
   - **Unidirectional Ring Network:** In this configuration, data travels in only one direction around the ring.
   - **Bidirectional Ring Network:** In this configuration, data can circulate in either direction around the ring. Bidirectional rings provide more flexibility and redundancy in case a segment of the ring fails.

4. **Fault Tolerance:** One advantage of a ring topology is its fault tolerance. If a single link or device fails, the data can still flow in the opposite direction, maintaining network connectivity. However, complete ring failure can occur if there is a break in the ring without redundancy measures in place.

5. **Topology Changes:** Adding or removing devices in a ring topology can be more challenging than in some other topologies. If a device is added or removed, the entire ring might need to be reconfigured.

6. **Use in LANs and WANs:** Ring topologies can be implemented in both local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). However, due to their potential for disruption if a device or link fails, they are often more commonly used in smaller-scale networks.

7. **Cabling:** As you mentioned, the type of cable used in a ring topology depends on the network cards installed in each device. Coaxial cables or RJ-45 network cables can be used, depending on the technology and requirements of the network.

8. **Example of Ring Topology in Real Life:**
   - **Token Ring Network:** The Token Ring network protocol, developed by IBM, is an example of a ring topology. In a Token Ring network, devices are connected in a physical ring, and data transmission is regulated by the passing of a token.

In summary, ring topology offers fault tolerance and orderly data transmission but may face challenges with topology changes. The use of token passing helps in managing data flow in a controlled manner.
