**Malware: Understanding the Threat from Beginner to Expert**

**Introduction:**
Malware, short for malicious software, is a pervasive and detrimental threat that affects computers, smartphones, tablets, and networks. Similar to the way flu outbreaks can spread in seasons, malware is a constant danger, aiming to invade, damage, or disable various digital systems. This comprehensive guide will take you from understanding the basics to advanced insights on malware, covering its definition, types, history, detection, and protection.

**What is Malware?**
Malware is an umbrella term encompassing any malicious program or code designed to harm systems intentionally. Comparable to the flu's interference with the human body, malware disrupts normal computer functions.
