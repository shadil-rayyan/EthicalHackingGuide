**Understanding Computer Viruses: From Beginner to Expert**

**Introduction:**
A computer virus is a malicious piece of code designed to replicate itself and infect other programs, often causing damage to files, system crashes, and malfunctions. Let's delve into the world of computer viruses, exploring their types, behaviors, and potential threats.

**Basic Concepts:**
- *Definition:* A virus is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program.
- *Self-Replication:* Viruses are self-replicating, spreading from one program to another.
- *Infection Mechanism:* A virus dropper, often disguised as a trojan horse, inserts the virus into the target system.

**Types of Viruses:**

1. **File Virus:**
   - Appends itself to the end of a file, altering the program's start to execute its code.
   - Leaves the host functional but modifies or destroys files.

2. **Boot Sector Virus:**
   - Infects the boot sector, executing during system boot.
   - Spreads to other bootable media, such as floppy disks.

3. **Macro Virus:**
   - Written in high-level languages like Visual Basic.
   - Activated when a program capable of executing a macro is run.

4. **Source Code Virus:**
   - Modifies source code to include and spread the virus.

5. **Polymorphic Virus:**
   - Changes its signature to evade antivirus detection while maintaining functionality.

6. **Encrypted Virus:**
   - Exists in encrypted form to avoid detection; carries a decryption algorithm.

7. **Stealth Virus:**
   - Alters its code to evade detection mechanisms.

8. **Tunneling Virus:**
   - Attempts to bypass antivirus detection by installing itself in the interrupt handler chain.

9. **Multipartite Virus:**
   - Infects multiple parts of a system, making detection challenging.

10. **Armored Virus:**
    - Coded to make it difficult for antivirus programs to understand.

11. **Browser Hijacker:**
    - Targets the user's browser, altering settings or redirecting to malicious sites.

12. **Memory Resident Virus:**
    - Installs in RAM, hiding within the system's operations.

13. **Direct Action Virus:**
    - Replicates and takes action when executed based on specified conditions.

14. **Overwrite Virus:**
    - Deletes information in infected files, rendering them useless.

15. **Directory Virus:**
    - Modifies file paths, infecting directories.

16. **Companion Virus:**
    - Creates files with similar names but different extensions.

17. **FAT Virus:**
    - Affects the File Allocation Table, potentially damaging crucial information on the disk.

**Conclusion:**
Understanding the diverse nature of computer viruses is crucial in adopting effective security measures. From file infections to stealthy manipulations, viruses pose a constant threat, necessitating vigilant cybersecurity practices to protect our digital world.
