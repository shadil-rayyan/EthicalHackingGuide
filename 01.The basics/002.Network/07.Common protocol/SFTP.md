Your provided information gives a comprehensive overview of the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), covering its purpose, capabilities, development history, and related topics. Here are a few additional suggestions and comments:

1. **SFTP Authentication:**
   - It might be beneficial to mention that SFTP typically relies on the underlying SSH protocol for authentication. As you state, it assumes a secure channel (SSH) and authenticated clients. However, explicitly noting that SFTP inherits the authentication mechanisms of SSH could enhance clarity.

2. **SFTP Versions:**
   - Consider highlighting key features or changes introduced in different versions of the SFTP protocol. For instance, you provide details on drafts 6â€“13 of version 6, but mentioning notable features or improvements introduced in each version could provide a more nuanced understanding.

3. **Extensions:**
   - In the section on extensions, you mention specific extensions like text-seek, supported2, acl-supported, etc. It might be helpful to provide a brief explanation of the purpose or use case for each extension, making the information more accessible to readers who may not be familiar with these terms.

4. **Software Section:**
   - When discussing SFTP software, particularly SFTP clients and servers, consider providing examples of popular implementations. Mentioning well-known software packages or tools that support SFTP, such as OpenSSH, can give readers practical insights into what they might encounter in real-world scenarios.

5. **SFTP Proxy:**
   - Explain in more detail the challenges associated with controlling SFTP transfers at the network perimeter and how tools like Shell Control Box and CryptoAuditor address these challenges. Providing examples or scenarios where SFTP proxies are useful could enhance the practical understanding of their role.

6. **Compatibility with SCP:**
   - It's worth noting explicitly that SFTP is different from SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), even though they both operate over SSH. Highlight the distinctions between SFTP and SCP, such as the extended capabilities of SFTP compared to SCP's more limited functionality.

7. **Usage with Other Protocols:**
   - Clarify that SFTP operates independently as a secure file transfer protocol but is often integrated with SSH servers. Emphasize that SFTP usage does not require FTP servers, and the default port for SFTP is port 22, which is shared with SSH.

8. **Benefits over Traditional FTP:**
   - Reiterate the security benefits of SFTP over traditional FTP, highlighting aspects such as encryption, authentication, and the secure channel provided by SSH.

9. **SFTP Command-Line Programs:**
   - While you mention the sftp program supplied with OpenSSH, you might want to highlight that there are various command-line SFTP clients available for different operating systems, providing users with flexibility in their choice of tools.

10. **Future Development:**
    - Consider adding information on recent developments or ongoing work related to the SFTP protocol, if available. This could include information on any recent updates, new features, or future plans for the protocol.

By addressing these points, your explanation of SFTP will become even more informative, covering various aspects of its usage, development, and practical considerations.
