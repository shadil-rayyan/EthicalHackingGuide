# Understanding Trojans: From Beginner to Expert

## Introduction to Trojan Horse Malware

A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is a form of malicious code or software designed to deceive users by appearing legitimate while actually compromising the security of their computer systems. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate; instead, users must execute them for the malware to take effect. Trojans can cause various types of harm, including data theft, system disruption, and unauthorized access.

## How Trojans Work

Trojans often exploit human vulnerabilities to infiltrate systems. For instance, a common tactic involves disguising the malware as a seemingly harmless email attachment. Users may unwittingly download and open the attachment, thereby allowing the Trojan to install itself on their device. Once executed, Trojans can spread to other files, causing damage to the computer.

## Common Types of Trojan Malware

Trojans come in various forms, each with a unique purpose. Some common types include:

1. **Backdoor Trojan:** Creates a backdoor on the infected computer, allowing attackers to control and steal data.
2. **DDoS Attack Trojan:** Conducts Distributed Denial of Service attacks, overwhelming networks with traffic from infected computers.
3. **Downloader Trojan:** Downloads and installs new versions of malicious programs on an already-infected system.
4. **Fake AV Trojan:** Behaves like antivirus software, demanding payment to detect and remove threats, real or fake.
5. **Ransom Trojan:** Seeks a ransom to undo damage done to the computer, such as blocking data or impairing performance.
6. **Trojan Banker:** Targets financial accounts to steal online banking, credit card, and bill pay information.

## Examples of Trojan Malware Attacks

Trojan malware attacks can cause significant damage, with some notable examples including the Rakhni Trojan and ZeuS/Zbot. These Trojans have evolved over time, incorporating new tactics such as delivering ransomware or conducting cryptojacking activities.

## Impact on Mobile Devices

Trojans aren't limited to desktops and laptops; they can also affect mobile devices. Cybercriminals often distribute Trojans through fake versions of legitimate apps, which, when downloaded, can steal information and generate revenue through premium SMS texts. The Switcher Trojan, for example, specifically targets Android devices, compromising routers on wireless networks.

## Protecting Against Trojans: Dos and Don'ts

### Dos:

1. Install and regularly run an internet security suite.
2. Update your operating system and software promptly.
3. Use complex, unique passwords for each account.
4. Employ firewalls to protect personal information.
5. Regularly back up your files.

### Don'ts:

1. Avoid visiting unsafe websites.
2. Refrain from opening links in emails from untrusted sources.
3. Only download or install programs from trusted publishers.
4. Ignore pop-up windows promising free, useful programs.
5. Exercise caution with email attachments; scan them before opening.

## Trojan War Winners and Losers

The term "Trojan" originates from the hollow wooden horse used by the Greeks during the Trojan War. Similarly, victims of Trojan malware may find themselves unknowingly welcoming malicious threats into their systems. Awareness, caution, and adherence to best security practices are essential to avoiding the pitfalls of Trojan infections.
